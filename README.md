Problem 1: Implementing English-to-German Translation with Transformer
In class, we worked on the notebook named "Attention_is_All_You_Need_코드_실습.ipynb", which focused on German-to-English translation using the Transformer model. Modify the code to build a model that performs English-to-German translation. Analyze the results of your model.

Problem 2: Sentiment Analysis Using BERT
Using the Twitter Sentiment Analysis dataset (with labels: Irrelevant, Neutral, Negative, Positive), perform sentiment analysis using the BERT model. Compare the classification performance metrics when using the pre-trained BERT model versus fine-tuning the model. Analyze if there is a difference in performance between the two approaches.

Problem 3: News Text Summarization with T5
The CNN-DailyMail News Text Summarization dataset consists of 300,000 news articles (Article) and summaries (Highlights).
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gowrishankarp/newspaper-text-summarization-cnn-dailymail 
Using the T5-based Text Summarization example discussed in class, create a model to summarize news articles. Evaluate the summarization performance of your model using ROUGE metrics and provide an analysis of the results.
